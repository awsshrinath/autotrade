**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Created Documentation File**: Initialized this `project_analysis_and_cleanup.md` file.
2.  **Eliminated Mock Data**: Removed the `_get_mock_positions` and `_get_default_summary` methods from `dashboard/data/trade_data_provider.py`. The system now returns empty lists or a "No data" status, preventing misleading information in the UI.
3.  **Tracked Mock Data Removal**: Created and completed Task #27 in Task Master to formally document the removal of mock data from the `TradeDataProvider`.

### `runner/`

The `runner/` directory contains the core trading logic. The analysis will focus on configuration, error handling, and the potential for mock data usage.

**Issues Found:**

*   **Silent Fallback Configuration**: The `runner/config.py` file was using a `FallbackConfig` class with hardcoded values, which could lead to the system running with an incorrect configuration without any warning.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Made Configuration Loading Robust**: Removed the silent fallback in `runner/config.py`. The system now raises a critical error and exits if the main `config_manager` cannot be loaded, preventing it from running with unintended default settings.
2.  **Centralized Offline Mode**: The `OFFLINE_MODE` flag is now fetched from the main configuration, removing the hardcoded value.
3.  **Tracked Configuration Fix**: Created and completed Task #28 in Task Master to document this improvement.

### `gpt_runner/`

The `gpt_runner/` directory seems to handle the AI/cognitive aspects of the trading bot.

## 3. Unused File and .gitignore Management

The next phase of the analysis will focus on identifying and removing unused files and updating the `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository.

**Unused Files Identified:**

*   `test_k8s_auth.py`: A script for testing Kubernetes-native GCP authentication. This was a development tool and is not needed for production.
*   `restart_dashboard.py`: A utility script for restarting the dashboard during local development. This is not part of the core application.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Deleted `test_k8s_auth.py`**: Removed the unused testing script.
2.  **Deleted `restart_dashboard.py`**: Removed the local development utility script.
3.  **Deleted `start_dashboard.sh`**: Removed the insecure local development script.

**`.gitignore` Updates:**

1.  **Improved `.gitignore`**: Updated the `.gitignore` file with more comprehensive patterns for Python virtual environments, log files, and temporary directories. The file was also reorganized for better readability.
2.  **Tracked `.gitignore` Update**: Created and completed Task #30 in Task Master to document this improvement.

## 4. Final Review and Summary

The final phase will involve a high-level review of all the changes, ensuring that all identified issues have been addressed and documented. I will then provide a final summary of the project's health and the actions taken.
