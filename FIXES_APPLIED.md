# Trading Bot Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing `analyze` method in VWAPStrategy (Critical Error)

**Problem**: The `VWAPStrategy` class was missing the `analyze()` method that the trading loop was trying to call, causing an `AttributeError: 'VWAPStrategy' object has no attribute 'analyze'`.

**Root Cause**: Method naming inconsistency across strategy classes.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added the missing `analyze()` method to `VWAPStrategy` class in `stock_trading/strategies/vwap_strategy.py`
- The method follows the same pattern as other strategy classes (`ORBStrategy`, `RangeReversalStrategy`)
- Includes intelligent signal filtering (only generates signals when price deviates >0.5% from VWAP)
- Returns trade signal dict or `None` if no valid signal found

**Files Modified**:
- `stock_trading/strategies/vwap_strategy.py`

### 2. Daily Plan Loading Timing Issue (Warning/Fallback)

**Problem**: Individual trading bots (stock-trader, options-trader, futures-trader) were starting up simultaneously with the main-runner and trying to fetch daily plans before they were created, resulting in "No daily plan found" warnings.

**Root Cause**: Kubernetes deployment architecture runs all containers simultaneously, but only the main-runner creates the daily plan.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `wait_for_daily_plan()` function to all bot runners
- Implements retry mechanism with 30-second intervals and 10-minute timeout
- Intelligent fallback strategy selection based on market conditions (VIX)
- Enhanced logging for better visibility into the process

**Retry Logic**:
```python
def wait_for_daily_plan(firestore_client, today_date, logger, max_wait_minutes=10):
    wait_interval = 30  # seconds
    max_attempts = (max_wait_minutes * 60) // wait_interval
    
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        daily_plan = firestore_client.fetch_daily_plan(today_date)
        if daily_plan:
            return daily_plan
        time.sleep(wait_interval)
    
    return None  # Timeout reached
```

**Intelligent Fallback**:
- **Stock Bot**: Uses VIX to choose between `vwap` (low volatility) and `range_reversal` (high volatility)
- **Options Bot**: Defaults to `scalp` strategy (most suitable for options)
- **Futures Bot**: Defaults to `orb` strategy (opening range breakout)

**Files Modified**:
- `stock_trading/stock_runner.py`
- `options_trading/options_runner.py` 
- `futures_trading/futures_runner.py`

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation
1. Main runner starts and creates daily plan within 5-10 minutes
2. Individual bots wait and successfully retrieve the plan
3. Bots use planned strategies with proper market sentiment context
4. Enhanced logging shows successful plan retrieval

### Scenario 2: Timeout/Fallback
1. If main runner fails or takes >10 minutes, bots timeout gracefully
2. Bots attempt to fetch market sentiment independently
3. Intelligent fallback strategy selection based on current market conditions
4. Enhanced logging shows fallback reason and selected strategy

## Monitoring

The following log patterns indicate successful fixes:

**Success Pattern**:
```
[PLAN] Daily plan found after 60 seconds
[PLAN] Using strategy from daily plan: vwap
```

**Intelligent Fallback Pattern**:
```
[TIMEOUT] Daily plan not found after 10 minutes, using fallback
[FALLBACK] Low VIX (12.5), using vwap strategy
```

**Error Resolution**:
- No more `'VWAPStrategy' object has no attribute 'analyze'` errors
- Reduced "No daily plan found" warnings
- Better strategy selection even in fallback scenarios

## Impact

✅ **Critical Error Fixed**: Stock trader no longer crashes due to missing analyze method
✅ **Improved Reliability**: Bots handle main runner delays gracefully  
✅ **Better Fallbacks**: Market-aware strategy selection even without daily plans
✅ **Enhanced Monitoring**: Better logging for debugging deployment timing issues
✅ **Zero Downtime**: Bots continue operating even if daily plan creation fails
