### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Core Trading Engine

-   **REQ-1.1:** The system must support trading for three distinct asset classes: Stocks, Options, and Futures.
    -   **Status:** `In Progress`
    -   **Priority:** High
-   **REQ-1.2:** Trading logic for each asset class must be encapsulated within its own isolated Kubernetes pod.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented`
    -   **Priority:** High
-   **REQ-1.3:** The system must support both live trading with real money and paper trading with simulated funds.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented`
    -   **Priority:** High
    -   **Acceptance Criteria:** A global `PAPER_TRADE` environment variable correctly switches between live and simulated execution via the `KiteConnectManager` and `PaperTradingManager`.
-   **REQ-1.4:** The system must be able to execute standard trade types (BUY, SELL, SHORT, COVER).
    -   **Status:** `Implemented`
    -   **Priority:** High

#### 2. AI & Strategy

-   **REQ-2.1:** An AI orchestrator (Main Runner) must analyze market data to generate a daily trading plan.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented`
    -   **Priority:** High
    -   **User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to automatically select the best strategy for the day so that I can capitalize on market conditions.
-   **REQ-2.2:** The daily plan must be stored in Firestore for trading pods to consume.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented`
    -   **Priority:** High
-   **REQ-2.3:** The system must support multiple, pluggable trading strategies (e.g., VWAP, ORB, Scalping).
    -   **Status:** `Implemented`
    -   **Priority:** Medium

#### 3. Monitoring & Dashboard

-   **REQ-3.1:** A web-based dashboard must provide a real-time overview of the system's status.
    -   **Status:** `In Progress`
    -   **Priority:** Medium
-   **REQ-3.2:** The dashboard must display the status of all Kubernetes pods (Running, Pending, Error).
    -   **Status:** `In Progress`
    -   **Priority:** Medium
-   **REQ-3.3:** The dashboard must show a feed of recent trades and system events from Firestore.
    -   **Status:** `In Progress`
    -   **Priority:** Medium
-   **REQ-3.4:** The dashboard must operate in a resilient, fallback mode if the backend API is unavailable.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented`
    -   **Priority:** High

#### 4. Logging & Auditing

-   **REQ-4.1:** All significant system events and trades must be logged.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented`
    -   **Priority:** High
-   **REQ-4.2:** Logs must be structured (JSON format) and include metadata such as `bot_type`, `category`, `log_level`, and `timestamp`.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented`
    -   **Priority:** High
-   **REQ-4.3:** Logs must be sent to two destinations:
    -   Google Firestore for real-time access.
    -   Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for long-term archival.
    -   **Status:** `Implemented`
    -   **Priority:** High

### Non-Functional Requirements

-   **NFR-1 (Performance):** Trade execution signals should be processed in under 500ms from signal generation to order placement.
-   **NFR-2 (Scalability):** The system must be able to scale the number of trading pods based on load, managed by Kubernetes HPA.
-   **NFR-3 (Reliability):** The system should have an uptime of 99.9%. Kubernetes deployment strategies (e.g., replicas) should be used to ensure high availability.
-   **NFR-4 (Security):** All sensitive credentials (API keys, secrets) must be stored securely using Kubernetes Secrets or a similar mechanism, and not hardcoded in the source code.
-   **NFR-5 (Maintainability):** Code must follow defined coding patterns, be well-documented, and include unit and integration tests.
